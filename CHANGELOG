== Coming soon
 * Optional libcurl implementations of the Request/Response classes (for those on MRI who need better performance) 
 * Cookie support
 * Proxy support 
 * 304/ETag response caching
  
== In progress
 * Adding live functional tests to codebase (see spec/functional no feasible way to spec drive Wrest::Resource otherwise)
 
== Current
 * Added redirect follow support for GET requests (see examples/redirection.rb)
 * Auto redirection limit
 * Request timeout limit config
 * Added an alias_accessor macro to allow alternative names for attribute accessors (see examples/wow_realm_status.rb) 
 * Removed the need to explicitly include AttributesContainer::Typecaster or to use the enable_typecasting_support macro. The call to typecast now does this for us. See AttributesContainer#typecast and AttributesContainer::Typecaster#typecast
   
== 0.0.8
 * Added URI extension using the [] method (see examples/delicious.rb)
 * Refactored out Request as the first step to adding Response caching
