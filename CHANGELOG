== In progress
 * Optional libcurl implementations of the Request/Response classes (for those on MRI who need better performance)
 * Adding live functional tests to codebase (see spec/functinal no feasible way to develop Wrest::Resource otherwise)
 * Cookie support
 * Proxy support 
 * 304/ETag response caching
 
== Current
 * Added redirect follow support for GET requests (see examples/redirection.rb)
 * Auto redirection limit
 * Request timeout limit config
