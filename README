REST client

* Basic infrastructure entities should be stand-alone and usable as such
* Should allow access to request/response objects
* Should be easy to extend and modify behaviour WRT to both serialisation/deserialisation as well as object creation
* Should have _no_ dependencies on Rails (usable in a pure Ruby application)
* The infrastructure should be structured so that higher level abstractions (like, say, ActiveResource) can be built over it
