Wrestis a REST client which allows you to quickly build object oriented wrappers around any web service.

* Basic infrastructure should be stand-alone and usable as such
* Should allow access to request/response objects
* Should be easy to extend and modify behaviour WRT to both serialisation/deserialisation as well as object creation
* Should have _no_ dependencies on Rails (usable in a pure Ruby application)
* The infrastructure should be designed so that higher level abstractions (like, say, ActiveResource) can be built over it


USAGE
Get Yahoo news as hash map (needs the JSON gem - gem install json):
"http://search.yahooapis.com/NewsSearchService/V1/newsSearch?appid=YahooDemo&output=json&query=India&results=3&start=1".to_uri.get.deserialise

You can try this in the console without having to require Wrest as a library by running script/console.
