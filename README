REST client

* Basic request structure should be stand-alone
* Should allow access to request/response objects
* Should be easy to extend and modify wrt to both serialisation/deserialisation as well as object creation
* Ultimately, one should be able to re-implement ActiveResource almost trivially over Wrest (but a more flexible version :))
